## Disclaimer

The Lark Parser team already provides an extension for Visual Studio Code that
includes syntax highlighting as part of the
[Lark grammar syntax support 竊余[dirk-thomas.vscode-lark] published in their
github organization [Lark Parser 竊余[github-lark-parser], gently provided by
[Dirk Thomas][github-dirk-thomas].

This extension is based on the same grammar but is actively maintained
independently by [Dynova 竊余[dynova-homepage] as an open source project.
